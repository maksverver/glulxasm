SAVE GAME FORMAT

The execution system uses an incompatible file format to store saved games,
which is not interoperable with any other system.

TECHNICAL INFORMATION

The save game file format mostly follows the Glulx/Quetzal format, including
compatible IFhd and CMem/UMem chunks. However, instead of the standard Stks
chunk to store the Glulx stack, an unportable stack chunk is included that
stores the game state for a particular version of the game on a particular
platform (i.e. this is not interoperable with anything else):

Preliminary chunk format:

    4 bytes: "XStk"
    4 bytes: remaining length of the chunk (at least 32 bytes)

   16 bytes: binary identifier (platform dependent; e.g. hash code of storycode)

    4 bytes: "call"
    4 bytes: call stack size in bytes (multiple of 4)
    X bytes: call stack data

    4 bytes: "data"
    4 bytes: data stack size in bytes (multiple of 4)
    X bytes: data stack data

  The format of all stack data is platform dependent. The 16 byte identifier is
  used by the loader to verify that the native stack data is applicable to the
  current platform and application.
