Contains some code from Glulxle (glkop.c) and Glk (gi_blorb.c) written by
Andrew Plotkin. See: http://eblong.com/zarf/{glulx,glk}/

-- 

Major missing features:
 - should load blorb at startup (for resources too)
 - saving/loading of game state in files
 - saving/loading of state for undoing

To figure out:
 - packaging; into four files:
    GLK-executable
    dynamic library containing native interpreter code
    dynamic library containing storyfile
    blorb file containing storyfile
