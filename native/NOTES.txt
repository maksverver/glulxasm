Contains some code (glkop.c) from Glulxle written by Andrew Plotkin.
See also: http://eblong.com/zarf/glulx/index.html

Major missing features:
 - load blorb at startup
 - saving/loading of game state in files
 - saving/loading of state for undoing

To figure out:
 - packaging; into four files:
    GLK-executable
    dynamic library containing native interpreter code
    dynamic library containing storyfile
    blorb file containing storyfile
