To figure out:
 - packaging; into four files:
    executable
    GLK library
    dynamic library containing native storyfile
    blorb file containing storyfile


Accelerated functions:
    8.7483%  func000939d4 (accel_func 1)
    7.1549%  func00093ace (accel_func 2)
    8.5797%  func00093179 (accel_func 3)
    1.3712%  func000931fd (accel_func 4)
    4.3512%  func000932ea (accel_func 5)
    2.7118%  func00092efb (accel_func 6)
    2.8420%  func00093287 (accel_func 7)
