Contains some code from Glulxle (glkop.c) and Glk (gi_blorb.c) written by
Andrew Plotkin. See: http://eblong.com/zarf/{glulx,glk}/

-- 

Major missing features:
 - should load blorb at startup (for resources too)
 - saving/loading of game state in files
 - saving/loading of state for undoing

To figure out:
 - packaging; into four files:
    GLK-executable
    dynamic library containing native interpreter code
    dynamic library containing storyfile
    blorb file containing storyfile

I've found some nice unittests on zarfs homepage. I don't expect to support
everything in this package, but at least here is a list of tests that fail:

glulxercise:
- 29 tests failed overall: jump (2), jumpform (20), iosys (7).
- failing "jump" are due to jumpabs not being supported
- failing "jumpform" are due to jump to indirect offset not being supported
- failing "iosys": reasons unknown
- all "filter" tests pass, even though filter subsystem is not supported?!

memcopytest:
- seems to work OK (no specific test cases given)
