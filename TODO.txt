general:
   - rethink calling conventions (to speed up direct calls)?

native:
   - support for loading/saving of gamestate (undo/save/restore/etc.)
   - maybe: support for native accellerated functions?
            (this might not be necessary; need to check generated code,
             and test performance impact of making function table non-const)
   - maybe: support for filter subsystem?

glulx-to-llvm:
    - write this! could be interesting.

glulx-to-c:
   + works OK

glulxd:
    + works OK

opcode-map:
    + now complete (though not all opcodes are implemented in a meaningful way)
