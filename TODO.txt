Makefile:
 - linker script doesn't seem to yield a valid executable on Windows 

garglk:
   - seems to be missing fonts?
     (Try examining church in Counterfeit Monkey for Greek text.)

general:
   - rethink calling conventions (to speed up direct calls)?
   - use valgrind to find memory leaks?

native:
   - undo code:
        make compression optional?
        limit total amount of memory used by undo stack (e.g. 4 times the
        maximum size of a snapshot?)
   - load storycode from DLL/.so
     (requires storing stack in position-independent format, or loading the
      storycode at a fixed address!)
   - maybe: support for native accellerated functions?
            (this might not be necessary; need to check generated code,
             and test performance impact of making function table non-const)
   - maybe: support for filter subsystem?
   - maybe: when saving, save (part of?) the undo stack in an extra chunk

glulx-to-llvm:
    - write this! could be interesting.

glulx-to-c:
   + works OK

glulxd:
    + works OK

opcode-map:
    + now complete (though not all opcodes are implemented in a meaningful way)
