glxd:
 - decode encoded strings, so they can be emitted as functions?

glulx-to-c/native:

opcode-map:
 - add code for missing opcodes

native:
 - support for true binary search
 - support for decoding strings with Huffman table
 - maybe later: support for native accellerated functions?

Later optimizations in C code generation:
 - convert use of stack to use of local variables
   e.g.
    copy 6, stk()
    copy 7, stk()
    call(2, stk(), stk())
   becomes
    int x = 6;
    int y = 7;
    call(2, x, y);
   this should at least avoid a lot of writes to the (global) stack
 - alternatively, make stack local (with alloca)?
   (need to test if the compiler is then able to elide writes)
 - resolve constant function addresses at compile-time
   (need to test if this isn't done already with the current func_map)
